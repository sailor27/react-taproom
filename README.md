| Placement of Edit Keg in Component Tree                                     | Making the tree, I was unsure where a component that edits an individual keg from the keg list would go. I eventually put it coming off of keg list, because that's where the data that would be modified by the user resides, but was unsure because I also imagined edit keg to be a dynamically routed page for each keg on the list.  | not found yet                                                                                                                                           |
| RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded                                | keg list component is mapping masterKegList using Keg model and index. Something is causing an infinite loop!                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | accidentally declared: import Keg from './KegList'; on KegList.

| console error: Unknown props `global`, `jsx` on style tag in app component  | This error started appearing when I added a style jsx tag with a global flag on App. It does not prevent the page from rendering, or the styles in the tag from appearing globally                                                                                                                                                        | not found yet                                                                                                                                           |
| Unexpected character ' ? ' when importing images                            | This error happened when I imported an image from the assets folder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | I forgot to install url-loader and file-loader packages, and add rules to the webpack config for loading image files. Resolved after I did these steps. |
