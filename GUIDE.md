* Components are used to create modular UI elements.
propTypes define data types and shapes for all component props.
* Application successfully uses client-side routing via the
* React-Router library to create appearance of multiple pages.
* Styles are successfully added using CSS objects.
* Project was submitted by the Friday deadline.
* Project demonstrates an understanding of this week's concepts.
* If prompted, you can discuss your code with an instructor using the correct terminology.

.DS_STORE
node_modules
build
```
2. Install webpack, React, ReactDOM, propTypes, babel transpiler, linter, webpack server, HMR, weback eslint loader, and style jsx.
```
npm install webpack@3.4.0 webpack-dev-server@2.5.0 eslint eslint-plugin-react -g   
```
```
npm install react@15.5.4 react-dom@15.5.4 react-router-dom prop-types@15.5.10 --save
```
```
npm install webpack@3.4.0 babel-core@6.24.1 babel-loader@7.0.0 babel-preset-es2015@6.24.1 babel-preset-react@6.24.1 webpack-dev-server@2.5.0 react-hot-loader@3.0.0-beta.7 html-webpack-plugin@2.29.0 eslint eslint-plugin-react eslint-loader  url-loader@0.6.2 file-loader@1.1.6 --save-dev
```
```
npm install --save styled-jsx
```

3. Configure .eslintrc.json, template.ejs, webpack.config
 * Copy config files from practice repo
 * eslint --init (set up eslint config file)
 * webpack-dev-server
 * npm run start
 * npm run lint
 * npm run lint-fix

4. Set up index.jsx with hash router and HMR. Set up App component with Switch. Create Keg List component. Test routing between components.

5. Create data model component and iterate data into the view.

6. Create data model component and iterate data into the view.

7. Wireframe style of components.

8. Refine style of components and resolve issues.
